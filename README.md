# Device Stability Prediction
Positional stability prediction for a gyroscope incorporated device using Machine Learning; given real time gyroscopic data (which consists of noises as well), machine learning model is expected to predict whether the device is stable or moving.

## Technical objective
- [x] Prediction of a positional stability of a gyroscope incorporated device.

## Learning objective
- [x] IoT perspective: Understand the nuances through own data collection from sensors.
- [x] Machine learning perspective: Start from basic machine learning algorithm for prediction.

## Dependencies to use the learnt model
- _Docker_
- _Python3+_
